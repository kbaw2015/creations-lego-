<h2> Lego car </h2>
<p> To make a simple LEGO car, first choose a flat LEGO plate to use as the base of the car. Attach two axles underneath the base and put two wheels on each axle, making sure the wheels can spin freely. Next, build the car body by stacking regular LEGO bricks on top of the base, keeping it low so the car stays balanced. Add a front using sloped or flat bricks to make it look like a car, and if you want, place a small brick inside as a seat for a driver. Finally, decorate the car with details like headlights, a windshield, or a spoiler, then gently push it on the floor to check that it rolls smoothly.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Car</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO car, start with a flat LEGO plate to use as the base, then attach two axles underneath and place two wheels on each axle, making sure the wheels spin freely. Next, stack regular LEGO bricks on top of the base to form the body of the car, keeping it low so it stays balanced. Add a front using sloped or flat bricks to make it look like a real car, and place a small brick inside as a seat if you want a driver. Finally, decorate the car with details like headlights or a windshield and test it by gently rolling it on the floor.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO House</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO house, begin with a large flat plate as the base and build walls by stacking bricks around the edges, leaving space for a door and windows. Once the walls are tall enough, add window pieces or gaps and place a brick frame for the door. Build the roof by layering flat or sloped bricks on top of the walls until the house is covered. You can add details like furniture, plants, or a chimney to make the house more interesting.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Robot</h2>
<p>To make a LEGO robot, start by building a strong base for the legs using stacked bricks, then attach a rectangular body on top. Add arms by connecting long bricks or hinged pieces to the sides of the body, and build a head using a small cube shape placed on top. Use different colored bricks, eyes, or buttons to give the robot personality, and adjust the arms and legs so the robot can stand without falling.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Boat</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO boat, begin with a long flat base and build up the sides using bricks to form the shape of a hull, keeping the middle open. Make the front slightly pointed so it looks like a real boat, then add a flat surface inside as the deck. You can build a small cabin or add a mast using tall bricks, and finish by decorating the boat with flags, railings, or seats.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Airplane</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO airplane, start with a long flat plate for the body of the plane, then stack bricks on top to make the main body thicker and stronger. Add wings by attaching flat plates to both sides of the body, making sure they are balanced. Build the tail by stacking a few bricks at the back and adding a small vertical fin. Finish the airplane by adding a cockpit with clear bricks or a smooth top, and decorate it with colors or symbols.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Bridge</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO bridge, begin by making two strong supports on opposite sides using stacked bricks. Connect the supports by laying long flat plates or bricks across the top to form the bridge deck. Strengthen the bridge by adding extra bricks underneath or along the sides. You can make it more realistic by adding railings, arches, or different colors to show lanes.</p>

<h2>How to Build a LEGO Animal</h2>
<p>To build a LEGO animal, start with a small body shape using stacked bricks, then add four short legs underneath so it can stand. Build a head separately and attach it to the front of the body, adding ears, eyes, or a snout depending on the animal you want. Finish by adding a tail and adjusting the shape until it looks like the animal you imagined.</p>
